# unit tests
This folder contains the unit tests of the project.

# Note
The tests are using the C++ [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) header only library. Catch2's main is notoriously slow to compile. If you're running the tests, just compile and run test_all.cpp which contains all tests and just one main.
